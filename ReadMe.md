# Sm4sh Rage Calculator

Hi! This project was an attempt at making life as a Smash Bros Wii U lab rat a little easier. In Smash Wii U, there is a mechanic called rage, which basically entails that as you take more damage, you also knock your opponent back further. While this can be helpful for getting KOs sometimes, a lot of players that spend a lot of time in the lab memorize percentages for certain combos and kill setups. The rage mechanic makes it difficult to predict if one of your combos or setups will still connect, because the extra knockback from rage can send the opponent out of range of the follow-up. 

This utility enables a player to determine how much effect rage is having when they hit their opponent with a certain attack while having a certain amount of damage percent. EX. If I were to hit Mario at 130% when my own character has 110% damage, and let's say I hit him with Pac-Man's fair, the knockback Mario receives is actually equivalent to me hitting him at 147%. 

## Installation

(Mac OS X)
- Download the 'Sm4shCalc_OSX.zip' file from the 'Applications' folder in this repository and unzip. The app inside can then be dragged and dropped into your Applications folder.

(Windows)
- Download the 'Sm4sh Rage Calc (Win).zip' file from the 'Applications' folder in this repository and decompress the file. Double click the Sm4sh Rage Calc executable file to run the program. Drag the entire folder into your Program Files folder.

## Usage

To use, select a character you would like to test against. Fill out a damage percentage for them, as well as one for yourself. For the next three entries (attack damage, knockback growth, base knockback), find the move you're testing under your character on http://kuroganehammer.com/smash4, and copy the Base Dmg., KBG, and BKB attributes to the respective fields. Then, hit the 'Calculate Equivalent Percent' button and check out the results.
